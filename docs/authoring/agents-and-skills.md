# Agents and Skills

Agents and skills are the runtime-visible content installed by a template.

## Agent Layout

An agent directory looks like:

```text
.agent_team/agents/worker/
├── agent.md
├── config.toml
└── skills/
    └── agent-private-skill/
        └── SKILL.md
```

`agent.md` contains frontmatter plus the system prompt body.

```md
---
description: Implements one assigned engineering task in an isolated worktree.
---

You are the worker agent...
```

The directory name becomes the agent name.

## Frontmatter

The loader uses a small stdlib parser, not a full YAML runtime dependency.

Supported frontmatter values are scalar and block-scalar fields needed by agent definitions. Keep the metadata simple and avoid relying on advanced YAML constructs.

`description` becomes the runtime-facing agent description.

## Inspecting Installed Agents

Use the CLI to inspect the definitions installed in a repo before launching one:

```sh
agent-team agent ls
agent-team agent show worker
```

Both commands accept `--json` for automation and `--format` for shell-friendly output. The plural alias also works:

```sh
agent-team agents ls --format '{{.Name}} {{len .Skills}}'
```

## Agent Config

`config.toml` assigns shared skills:

```toml
[skills]
extra = ["linear", "pull-request", "status"]
```

The loader resolves:

1. agent-private skills under `<agent>/skills/`
2. shared skills under `.agent_team/skills/`
3. arbitrary paths listed in config

## Skill Layout

A skill directory contains a `SKILL.md` entrypoint and optional supporting files.

```text
.agent_team/skills/status/
├── SKILL.md
└── scripts/
    ├── status.sh
    └── _status_write.py
```

Bundled skills include:

| Skill | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `linear` | Query or mutate Linear through configured team metadata |
| `pull-request` | Guide PR creation and review handoff |
| `status` | Write `status.toml` for daemon/operator visibility |
| `inbox` | Read daemon mailbox messages |
| `channel` | Pub/sub channel helpers |
| `assign-worker` | Manager workflow for assigning work to workers |

## Runtime Registration

`agent-team run <agent>`:

1. loads every installed agent
2. resolves each agent's prompt and description
3. builds a runtime-specific agent registry
4. creates a temporary discovery tree for selected skills
5. writes a kickoff prompt file
6. creates `.agent_team/state/<instance>/`
7. execs the selected runtime

Environment passed to the runtime includes:

| Variable | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `AGENT_TEAM_ROOT` | Absolute path to `.agent_team/` |
| `AGENT_TEAM_INSTANCE` | Current instance name |
| `AGENT_TEAM_STATE_DIR` | Absolute path to the current instance state dir |
| `AGENT_TEAM_DAEMON_SOCKET` | Resolved Unix socket path for `agent-teamd`; falls back to `.agent_team/daemon.sock` on short paths |

## Status Reporting

Agents should write status through the status skill.

`status.toml` lets operators and repair commands understand:

- current phase
- human-readable description
- whether work is blocked
- job/ticket ownership
- branch and PR metadata

Typical phases include:

- `planning`
- `implementing`
- `awaiting_review`
- `blocked`
- `idle`
- `done`

Status files are read by `ps`, `inspect`, `monitor`, `health --jobs`, `job reconcile status`, `job triage`, and team-scoped views.

## Skill Design Guidelines

Good skills should:

- be explicit about required config
- use structured files where possible
- avoid hidden global state
- write durable status when they make long-running progress
- fail loudly when required external tools are missing
- be safe to run from worktrees
- keep scripts portable and dependency-light

## Code Areas

Agent and skill loading lives mostly in:

- `internal/loader/frontmatter.go`
- `internal/loader/loader.go`
- `internal/cli/run.go`
- `internal/cli/runtime.go`
- `template/agents/`
- `template/skills/`
